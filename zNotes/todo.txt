Groceries

Recipe:
    - Add a "add food" option in the recipe creation template and redirect back to that page

Enhancements:
    - Figure out how to redirect to last page on all paginated templates
    - Redirect to last page when adding food from the recipe creation template
    - scrape web for deals and coupons for Groceries
    - add Grocery Store object so I can add foods for several different grocery stores
    
Future Research:
	- I need to figure our how to manage the database. Dumpdata and Loaddata options are not as straightforward as they seem.
