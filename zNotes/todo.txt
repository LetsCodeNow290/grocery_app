Work on placing an M2M field in the recipe model for ingredients:
    - Right now each ingredient is linked to a recipe with the "linked_recipe" field in the recipe
        To access all the ingredients in a recipe, Django goes through each ingredient object and compares the "linked_recipe" to the desired recipe.
    - The best way to access ingredients in a recipe is to store all the ingredient objects in the recipe object but I didn't know how to do this when I made the model
        This will be complicated and I'll have to rewrite a good bit of code, but it's necessary and will speed things up when the database is big
