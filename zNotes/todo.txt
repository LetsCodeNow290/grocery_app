Components
    - Add a search feature for all the categories

Groceries:
    - Create a remove by recipe feature
    - Re-do the print_list feature so that it is easier to read on paper. Maybe use xlsx writer or find a way to format a text document

Recipe:
    - Remove ingredients from recipes in the Update view
    - Test recipe validation

Enhancements:
    - Create a feature that scans previous grocery lists and offers those items up to pre-populate a new list
    - add Grocery Store object so I can add foods for several different grocery stores
        > For this to work, I will have to remove the "aisle" attribute from Food and add it to a new model within the grocery store models.py.
        > I think it'll look a lot like a GroceryList in that a grocery store will contain 2 models. One will be a food container that defines a food and marries it to an aisle. The otehr will be a grocery store that contains that new food container and also the attributes of a grocery store.
    - Figure out how to redirect to last page on all paginated templates
    - Redirect to last page when adding food from the recipe creation template
    - scrape web for deals and coupons for Groceries
    
Future Research:
	- I need to figure our how to manage the database. Dumpdata and Loaddata options are not as straightforward as they seem.
