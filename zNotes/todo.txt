Components
    - Add a search feature for all the categories

Groceries

Recipe:
    - Remove ingredients from recipes in the Update view
    - Test recipe validation

Enhancements:
    - Investigate custom validation in the model. I tried to add custom validation and I cannot update an existing object. I need to de-dup recipe and food
    - Figure out how to redirect to last page on all paginated templates
    - Redirect to last page when adding food from the recipe creation template
    - scrape web for deals and coupons for Groceries
    - add Grocery Store object so I can add foods for several different grocery stores
    
Future Research:
	- I need to figure our how to manage the database. Dumpdata and Loaddata options are not as straightforward as they seem.

Use the django-environ module to set environmental variables
