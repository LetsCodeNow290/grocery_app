Install git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) directions at this web site
Open a command shell
Ensure git is installed and mapped to PATH with (git --version)
If the git command isn't recognized, map git to PATH (https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)
Directions to map to PATH in above URL. Use same method to map python and pip if needed
Next, install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Make sure pip is installed (pip --verison)
With pip, install venv with (pip install venv)
Create and navigate to working directory. (Example: C:\Users\username\WorkingDirectory\)
In the working directory, create a directory for the django project
Place all of the files from github in the django project directory
Next, in the working directory, create a virtual environment for this project with (python -m venv .)
Activate the virtual environment with (.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat)
Should now look like this ("(venv)C:\Users\username\WorkingDirectory\")
Navigate to the django project directory (Example: C:\Users\username\WorkingDirectory\django_project\)
Type (pip freeze) to ensure pip is installed in the virtual environment
Type (pip install -r requirements.txt) to install everything for the project
Create another superuser with (python manage.py createsuperuser) and work through the prompts
Start the server with (python manage.py runserver)
Hopefully the server starts without any issues
Open a browser and type (localhost:8000) OR (127.0.0.1:8000) and log in
Use ctrl+C in the command prompt to stop the server
