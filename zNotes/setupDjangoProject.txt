Install git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) directions at this web site
Open a command shell
Ensure git is installed and mapped to PATH with (git --version)
If the git command isn't recognized, map git to PATH (https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)
Directions to map to PATH in above URL. Use same method to map python and pip if needed
Next, install python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Make sure pip is installed (pip --verison)
With pip, install venv with (pip install venv)
Create and navigate to working directory. (Example: C:\Users\username\WorkingDirectory\)
In the working directory, create a directory for the django project
Navigate to django project directory and clone the git repo (git clone https://github.com/LetsCodeNow290/grocery_app.git)
Next, back in the working directory, create a virtual environment for this project with (python -m venv .)
Activate the virtual environment with (.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat)
Should now look like this ("(venv)C:\Users\username\WorkingDirectory\")
Navigate to the django project directory (Example: C:\Users\username\WorkingDirectory\django_project\)
Type (pip freeze) to ensure pip is installed in the virtual environment
Type (pip install -r requirements.txt) to install everything for the project
Migrate the changes with (python manage.py migrate)
Create another superuser with (python manage.py createsuperuser) and work through the prompts
If you want to initialize a database fill, this would be the time to do that
Start the server to run on only your local machine with (python manage.py runserver)
***To start the server to run on your local NETWORK use (python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0.:8000)
    *In the command above "0.0.0.0" will default to your machine's IP address. You could also just use you machine's IP address.
    *The port number following the "0.0.0.0", "8000" in the example above" could be anything. Use port "80" to make life easier but you cannot have any other webservers running on your machine. I'll explain on the next line.
Hopefully the server starts without any issues
Open a browser and type (localhost:8000) OR (127.0.0.1:8000) and log in
    *If you are making the site available to your local network and you used port 80, all you have to type in the browser is the webserver's IP. No need to type in the port number. This makes things easier if you want to create a DNS entry for your project. 
Use ctrl+C in the command prompt to stop the server
